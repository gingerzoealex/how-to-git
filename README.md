# how-to-git

A fun project with my bf as a fun way to collaboratively learn git, Sass, Ruby, & CI/CD that may or may not spiral into chaos.

_tldr; I don't know much._

Clone this thing:

`git clone git@github.com:gingerzoealex/how-to-git.git`

Make sure you're using Ruby:

`ruby -v`

If not, [install it](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

Install Jekyll using Bundler:

`gem install jekyll bundler` 

Start the project server from within this repo's folder with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
